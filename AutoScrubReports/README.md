# AutoScrubReports

AutoScrubReports is a Google Apps Script that removes access to files in a designated folder in your Google Drive after they reach a particular age. For each of these files, the following is done:

 1. Any users who have been explicitly granted access to view, edit, or comment on the file have their access removed.
 2. The file sharing permissions are set to *private*. If the file was previously configured to be accessible to anyone with the link, that link will no longer grant access.
 3. The file is moved to the trash. **It will remain possible to restore the file until you [manually delete the file or empty your trash](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375102) in Google Drive.**
